# DeepRiver - Private, secure and simple chat system

DeepRiver is a python-to-js based chatting system that supports multi-room setup. No data gets logged and no unnecessary data leakage. As it should be.

## Whats so different about this chat-app?
Well, the fact that it's open source and just doesnt limit peoples ability to stay private. Users can create private rooms with passwords. These rooms only stay online while the server is online. All messages sent to and from are not beeing kept on any server storage. It's all sent in one-only copy. No "backups" are being kept of any messages. When the room is empty, it gets destroyed with all the messages.

## Who is this for?
This is for people who just want to talk privately. Or for people who want to hang out with othr strangers in public rooms. The possibilities are limitless.

# The roadmap
- [ ] Create DeepRiver v1.0
- [ ] Host a public mirror of this project for public use
